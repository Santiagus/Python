# Playground to test python profiling tools.

Examples in this folder shows some ways to optimize python code performance.

For measurement of the different code verions some decorator funcions are defined in :

- async_performance_decorators.py : For async functions
- performance_decorators.py : For sync functions

*NOTE:* Decorators use PsUtil tools. psutil is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors)
